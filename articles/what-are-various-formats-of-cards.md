Okay, so here we are - we know the anatomy of a Card in Horntell ([read this]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/anatomy-of-a-card), in case you don't know), now let's get to know various formats that are available to you for use.

> **Tip:** We are always adding newer formats. Keep this page handy to stay updated.

As you know, a Card is majorly made up of two parts - `include` and `action`. The two parts work independently to each other. Each of the two parts has various available formats that can be mixed and matched to create the perfect card.

#### INCLUDE

The **Include** part allows you to embed rich content in a Card. The available formats to describe your content are:

- **Quote**

	The format `quote` allows the possibility to embed conversation-like components. These can be used to embed comments, messages, chats, etc.

#### ACTION

The **action** part allows you to define an action that the user can take in the Card. The currently supported actions are:

- **Reactions**

	The format `reactions` allows the user to send quick sentiments on something. This can be used to collect quick feedbacks.

- **Choice Reply**

	The format `choice_reply` allows the user to either reply or pick a choice. These come handy in situation where you want, for instance, the user to either leave a comment on a photo or simply like it.

- **Choice General**

	The format `choice_general` allows you to define varied ways for your user to pick the choices. You can have many choices sent and also control how many could be picked up.

- **Pay**

	The format `pay` allows you to accept payments via the Cards itself. You can also control if you want to allow the user to confirm order via Cash or not. We can also ask for Shipping Address from the user if you want.
