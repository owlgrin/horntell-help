Terminology (no jargon, promise)

There are just 3 important terms in Horntell around which our whole discussion will revolve. They are:

**Profiles:**

Notifications are user-specific. Your every user has a corresponding profile created in Horntell account. A **user** in your app is called a **profile** in Horntell.

**Horns:**

These are the push notifications in Horntell’s terms. (We got tired of typing out the long word **notifications** over and over again. :) ;)

**Campaigns:**

In our beta, we found our users hardcoding the notification’s content in their codebase. This meant that to change the content, they’d to go through the long shipping cycle. Ugh! Using campaigns, you can save the content of the horn in your dashboard as a template and put the identifier of the campaign in your codebase. Need to change the content? Do it on the fly from your dashboard. Sweet!
