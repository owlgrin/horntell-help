summary:    Here's what is a Card made up of.

A Card is not some mumble jumble of nested views, but instead it is a neat packaging of various components working together. There are five major parts of a Card. Let's see them one at a time.

- **App Branding**

	Your app's logo and name is the first thing that the Card shows. We've tested and proved that having the app's branding on the Card helps in better conversions.

- **Timestamp**

	The timestamp of the Card shows in the top right corner to let the user know when the Card was delivered to her.

- **One Liner Context**

	There's a one line context that you can use to set the tone of the whole Card. It simply tells what the Card is about.

- **Include**

	The `include` part allows you to embed rich content in the Card to provide deeper context of the Card.

- **Action**

The `action` part allows you to embed an action in the Card that the user can take.

You can know more about various formats of `include` and `action` [here]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/what-are-various-formats-of-cards) that are available for you to use.
