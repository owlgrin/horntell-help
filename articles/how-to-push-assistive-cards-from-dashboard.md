summary:    Very handy way to send Cards.

While mostly you'll use API to sending Cards, pushing from dashboard might be required to broadcast or when testing and developing.

We're assuming that you've got the [Android SDK (Horntell Zed) integrated]({{site.baseurl/articles/how-to-integrate-horntell-zed}}) in your app and also have at least one campaign added to the account.

- If you [log in](http://app.horntell.com) your Horntell account</a>, you will see one profile that got created when you got your [Horntell Zed integrated]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/how-to-integrate-horntell-zed) in your webpage. Do you see it?
![profile]({{site.baseurl}}/images/articles/profile.png)

- There are three buttons below each profile, but weâ€™ll focus on just the second one for now. Hit the <i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> and a small window will pop up.

- Hit the **Trigger** button corresponding to any campaign that is in your account.

- Check the phone where the integrated app is installed and voila, do you see something?

While it was very interesting to send our first Card, we highly recommend you to know more about [various templates of Cards]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/what-are-various-formats-of-cards) to make most out of them.
