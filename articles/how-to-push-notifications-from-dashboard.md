While mostly you'll use API to push notifications, pushing from dashboard might be required to do one-time notifications or when testing and developing.

1. If you [log in](http://app.horntell.com) your Horntell account</a>, you will see one profile that got created when you got your [Horntell Center integrated]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/how-to-integrate-horntell-center) in your webpage. Did you see it?

2. There are three buttons below each profile, but weâ€™ll focus on just the first one for now. Hit the <i class="fa fa-bell"></i> and a small window will pop up.

3. To simply try out how notifications are pushed, we'll ignore everything for now in the small window and simply paste this in the input field: "`Does this really work? Oh god, this does work!`".

4. Hit **Send**.

5. Open the webpage where your widget was integrate and voila, did you see something? So this does actually work. :)

While it was very interesting to send our first (and simple) notification, we highly recommend you to know more about [various formats notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/what-are-various-formats-of-notifications) to make most out of them.
