### Horns

Horns are the push notifications in Horntellâ€™s dictionary. A horn is much more than a simple Facebook-like notification. A horn can be of multiple formats, which can be remembered by the following acronym: **SALT**.

**S: Simple:** A simple horn is just a heads-up for your users. User cannot interact with the notifications at all except from reading it (or send HTML to make it interactive).

**A: Ask:** A ask horn allows you to ask questions (or surveys) to your users. Ask horn provides the interactivity of buttons that can be clicked to record the response.

**L: Link:** A link horn is the notification which can be clicked upon to direct users to reach on a different page. These are the notifications that you already are aware about.

**T: Talk:** A talk horn allows you to add input interactivity to your notifications. The horn will be supported with an input box in which your user can type in the response. These are great to collect quick feedbacks and talk to your users.
