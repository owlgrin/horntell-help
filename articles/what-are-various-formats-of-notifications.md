Okay, so here we are - we know how notifications work in Horntell ([read this]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/how-to-push-notifications-from-dashboard), in case you don't know), letâ€™s get to know a bit more about them now.

Our vision is that in this notification-driven world, notification should not only be "informative" but also "interactive". Horntell gives you option to choose from 4 formats of notifications.

**Simple:** A simple horn is just a heads-up for your users. User cannot interact with the notifications at all except from reading it (or send HTML to make it interactive).

**Ask:** A ask horn allows you to ask questions (or surveys) to your users. Ask horn provides the interactivity of buttons that can be clicked to record the response.

**Link:** A link horn is the notification which can be clicked upon to direct users to reach on a different page. These are the notifications that you already are aware about.

**Talk:** A talk horn allows you to add input interactivity to your notifications. The horn will be supported with an input box in which your user can type in the response. These are great to collect quick feedbacks and talk to your users.
